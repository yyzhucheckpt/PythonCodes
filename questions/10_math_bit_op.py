#Leetcode 13. Roman to Integer
"""
Description:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 
12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. 
Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. 
The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

#Leetcode 8. String to Integer (atoi)
"""
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.

Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. 

Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. 
Assume the result is positive if neither is present.

Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. 
The rest of the string is ignored.

Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). 
If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).

If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], 
then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, 
and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Example 1:
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: "   -42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)            ^
Step 2: "   -42" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)             ^
Step 3: "   -42" ("42" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.

Example 3:
Input: s = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)         ^
Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')         ^
Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1),

To determine how you "say" a digit string, 
split it into the minimal number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. 
Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":

'''
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 
Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
Example 3:
