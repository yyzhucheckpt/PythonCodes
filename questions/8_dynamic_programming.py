Leetcode 746 - Min Cost Climbing Stairs
Description:
On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. 
You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, 
and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Note:
1.cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].

2.Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].

Example 1:
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]

Output: 15

Explanation:
Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.

Example 2:
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]

Output: 6

Explanation:

Explanation:
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
